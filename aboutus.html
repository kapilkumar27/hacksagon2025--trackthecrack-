    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>

<section>
    <p>
        At TracktheCrack, we believe safe roads shouldn't be a privilege---they should be a default. That's why we've built a community powered platform to spot,share and solve road hazards before they turn into accidents.
        Because here's the truth: a pothole isn't just an inconvenience. A loose manhole cover isn't just an eyesore. These are real threats to real lives-- ignoring them doesn't make them go away. With TracktheCrack, every user becomes a safety sensor, every report becomes a warning signal, and every click pushes us closer to safer streets.
        We have combined real-time reporting, interactive maps, and user-driven data into a single, powerful tool-- so that whether you're walking, driving, cycling or riding-- you're alaways one step ahead of danger. No more blind spots. No more hoping someone else will report it. Now, you can.
        TracktheCrack isn't just about technology. It's about building a culture of responsibility, where awarness is as common as commuting-- and where safety isa shared effort. 
        This is more than a website. It's a movement. And it starts with every crack you track. <br> <br>

        <b>What We Do</b><br>
        <b>* Track:</b>Get updates on road hazards near you-- from potholes to flooding zones.<br>
        <b>*Map:</b>See exactly where trouble lies with our interactive hazard maps.<br>
         <b>*Report:</b>Snap,pin, and post hazards in seconds. Because awarness saves lives. <br><br>
        
         <b>Why We Built This</b><br>
         TracktheCrack was created by a team of young innovators who wanted to turn daily raod frustations into real-time alerts, actionable data, and eventually--policy change.<br>
         We're not just another map app. We're a movement.
